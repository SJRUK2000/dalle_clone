Introduction

Welcome to My DALLE Project, This project is a full-stack web application that utilizes the power of OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate custom images for users and allows them to share them with the community. 
The application is built using the MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB for the database, Express for the back-end, Node.js for the server-side runtime environment and React for the front-end,
Additionally Tailwind CSS is used for the styling and Cloudinary is utilized as the cloud-based image hosting service.

Users can generate images, upload them to the community showcase located on the home page, and search for other users' posts. 
This application is under development and should be deployed soon.
